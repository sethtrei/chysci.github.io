<a href="http://sethtrei.github.io/chysci.github.io"> Website </a>

Chysci Robotics is a South Jersey based science group that is part of 4-H. We had a Weebly website but now that we now HTML, CSS and JS we can make our own site from scratch. 

# Problems We Ran Into

So far, making this website is going smoothly. We will probably never be done as there are endless possibilities. The only problem was getting @XenonMolecule to get credit for his commits. When he would commit it would say @sethtrei did the commit.Chysci Robotics Group Website
