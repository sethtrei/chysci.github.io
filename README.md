# Chysci Robotics Group Website by Seth Treiman & Michael Ryan 

<a href="http://sethtrei.github.io/chysci.github.io"> Website </a>

Chysci Robotics is a South Jersey based science/robotics/programming group that is part of 4-H. We had a Weebly website but now that we know HTML, CSS and JS we can make our own site from scratch. 

# Problems We Ran Into

So far, making this website is going smoothly. We will probably never finish as there are endless possibilities. The only problem was getting [@XenonMolecule](https://github.com/XenonMolecule) to get credit for his commits. When he would commit it would say [@sethtrei](https://github.com/sethtrei) did the commit.
